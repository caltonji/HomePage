			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				I'm a third year Georgia Tech student.  What does that mean to me? It means that I spend a lot of time following directions that people give me.  It means that I know a lot of theoretical things.  I take a lot of honors math classes.
				<br>
				I'm from Chicago but Atlanta is as much my home as anywhere.  I work at AirWatch 9-5 and at Atlanta's coffee shops from 7-10.  I've done some cool things before.
				<br>
				Right now most of my cranial energy is spent on organizing the Startup Exchange Fall Schedule and thinking up random hacks to make me look better and feel cooler.
				<br>
				Check out some of my projects and hipsterish pictures.
